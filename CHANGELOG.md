Every published release will now include a changelog entry.

A `git` tag will be dropped at v1.0.0 when that's released.

## v1.0.0

* Add support for an Array of `koa-router` passed as `targetRouters`
* Add support for using `ioredis` to back rate-limits in far-cache
* Add tools for maintainer(s) to best manage releases post v1.0.0

## Pre-v1.0.0

WARNING: These versions may break backward compatibility.

### v0.9.4: added CHANGELOG.md

* Bumped dependencies to latest to fix e.g. `lodash` vulnerability (low)
